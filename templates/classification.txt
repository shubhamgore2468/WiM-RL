I asked an LLM assistant whether a piece of document is related to the query: "{query}". This is its answer: 
```text
{answer}
```
Should I save it for later? 
Here are rules:
- Answer YES if the answer contains information about the query. 
- Answer NO if the answer says the piece isn't related to the query.

Provide the answer in the format: <YES/NO>#<Explanation>. 
Here is are example answers:

YES#Yes, the information contains an excerpt from a book that is related to the question.
NO#No, the LLM assistant concluded the information isn't relevant.

Don't add any other comments, all your remarks should be included in the "Explanation" section.
