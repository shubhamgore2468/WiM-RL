The compromise resolved the deadlock in Congress.  Southerners were blocking the assumption of state debts by the treasury, thereby destroying the Hamiltonian program for building a fiscally strong nation state.  Northerners rejected the proposal, much desired by Virginians, to locate the permanent national capital on the Virginia-Maryland border.  The compromise made possible the passage of the Residence and Funding (Assumption) Acts in July and August 1790.  Historian Jacob Cooke says it is, \"generally regarded as one of the most important bargains in American history, ranking just below the better known Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850.\" The Anti-Nebraska movement was a political alignment in the United States formed in opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 and to its repeal of the Missouri Compromise provision forbidding slavery in U.S. territories north of latitude 36° 30' N.  (At the time, the name \"Nebraska\" could loosely refer to areas west of the Missouri River.) The Republican Party, also commonly called the GOP (for \"Grand Old Party\"), is one of the world's oldest extant political parties.  It is the second oldest existing political party in the United States after its primary rival, the Democratic Party.  It emerged in 1854 to combat the Kansas–Nebraska Act, an act that dissolved the terms of the Missouri Compromise and allowed slave or free status to be decided in the territories by popular sovereignty.  The Party had almost no presence in the Southern United States, but by 1858 in the North it had enlisted former Whigs and former Free Soil Democrats to form majorities in nearly every Northern state. William King (February 9, 1768June 17, 1852) was an American merchant, shipbuilder, army officer, and statesman from Bath, Maine.  A proponent of statehood for Maine, he became its first governor when it separated from Massachusetts in 1820. Henry Smith Lane (February 24, 1811 – June 19, 1881) was a United States Representative, Senator, and the 13th Governor of Indiana; he was by design the shortest-serving Governor of Indiana, having made plans to resign the office should his party take control of the Indiana General Assembly and elect him to the United States Senate.  He held that office for only two days, and was known for his opposition to slavery.  A Whig until the party collapsed, he supported compromise with the south.  He became an early leader in the Republican Party starting in 1856 serving as the president of the first party convention, delivering its keynote address, and was influential in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln.

This parallel of latitude is particularly significant in the history of the United States as the line of the Missouri Compromise, which was used to divide the prospective slave and free states west of the Mississippi River, with the exception of Missouri, which is mostly north of this parallel. The 1820 Maine gubernatorial election took place on April 3, 1820.  It was the first election for Governor of Maine, taking place after Maine separated from Massachusetts and was recognized as a state on March 15, 1820.  Maine's separation from Massachusetts came as a result of The Missouri Compromise.  This election saw the virtually unanimous election of William King, the man most chiefly responsible for the push for Maine statehood.  He had no opponents. The Pottawatomie massacre occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856.  In reaction to the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces, John Brown and a band of abolitionist settlers—some of them members of the Pottawatomie Rifles—killed five settlers north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas.  This was one of the many bloody episodes in Kansas preceding the American Civil War, which came to be known collectively as Bleeding Kansas.  Bleeding Kansas was largely brought about by the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas–Nebraska Act. The Missouri Compromise is the title generally attached to the legislation passed by the 16th United States Congress on May 8, 1820.  The measures provided for the admission of Maine as a state along with Missouri as a slave state, thus maintaining the balance of power between North and South.  As part of the compromise, slavery was prohibited North of the 36°30′ parallel, excluding Missouri.  President James Monroe signed the legislation on April 6, 1820. Dred Scott (c. 1799 – September 17, 1858) was an enslaved African American man in the United States who unsuccessfully sued for his freedom and that of his wife and their two daughters in the \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" case of 1857, popularly known as the \"Dred Scott Decision\".  Scott claimed that he and his wife should be granted their freedom because they had lived in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory for four years, where slavery was illegal.  The United States Supreme Court decided 7–2 against Scott, finding that neither he nor any other person of African ancestry could claim citizenship in the United States, and therefore Scott could not bring suit in federal court under diversity of citizenship rules.

    "query": "Creature Comforts is a stop motion clay animation comedy mockumentary franchise originating in a 1989 British humorous animated short film of the same name.  The film matched animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes, making it appear as if the animals were being interviewed about their living conditions.  It was created by Nick Park and Aardman Animations.  The film later became the basis of a series of television advertisements for the electricity boards in the United Kingdom, and in 2003, a television series in the same style was released.  An American version of the series was also made. Tata Steel Zoological Park is situated in the corner most area of Jubilee Park.  This zoo is known for its Safari Park, which enables tourists to drive through the wooden area, where animals roam freely.  Tourists can also visit the Nature Education Centre in the zoo, which gives information about the zoo animals. Nicholas Wulstan \"Nick\" Park, CBE (born 6 December 1958) is an English director, writer and animator best known as the creator of \"Wallace and Gromit\" and \"Shaun the Sheep\".  Park has been nominated for an Academy Award a total of six times, and won four with \"Creature Comforts\" (1989), \"The Wrong Trousers\" (1993), \"A Close Shave\" (1995), and \"\" (2005). Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo is a platform video game, the first featuring Aardman Animations' characters Wallace & Gromit.  The game was developed by Frontier Developments for the PlayStation 2, Xbox (not compatible with Xbox 360), GameCube and Microsoft Windows.  The game features the voice of Wallace, Peter Sallis. Wallace and Gromit's World of Invention is a science-themed miniseries featuring the animated claymation characters Wallace and Gromit, made by Aardman and aired on BBC One.  The BBC said in a press statement that in the series, \"Wallace will take a light hearted and humorous look at the real-life inventors, contraptions, gadgets and inventions, with the silent help of Gromit.  The series aims to inspire a whole new generation of innovative minds by showing them real, but mind-boggling, machines and inventions from around the world that have influenced his illustrious inventing career.\" Exotic ungulate encephalopathy is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease, identified in infected organs of zoo animals.  This subgroup of the TSEs in captive animals was identified in zoo animals in Great Britain including species of greater kudu, nyala, gemsbok, the common eland, Arabian and Scimitar Oryx, an Ankole-Watusi cow, and an American bison.  Studies indicate that transmission likely occurred via the consumption of feed supplemented with meat and bone meal, although some animals died after the British ban on ground offal in animal feed.  All animals died during the 1990s, with the last death occurring in 1998. Wallace and Gromit is a British clay animation comedy series created by Nick Park of Aardman Animations.  The series consists of four short films and a feature-length film.  The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, along with his companion Gromit, a silent yet loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic dog.  Wallace was originally voiced by veteran actor Peter Sallis, but as of 2011, this role has been passed on to Ben Whitehead.  Gromit remains silent, communicating only through means of facial expressions and body language. Wallace & Gromit's Musical Marvels (also known as Wallace & Gromit at the Proms) is the name of Prom 20 of the 2012 season of The BBC Proms, which features orchestral renditions of Julian Nott's theme from Wallace & Gromit and classical music set to scenes from the Wallace & Gromit films.  Wallace is performed by Ben Whitehead, the actor who performed Wallace in the episodic adventure game series, Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures.

Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe.  The incident was recorded on video and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to kill Harambe.

    "generated_text": "Creature Comforts is a stop motion clay animation comedy mockumentary franchise originating in a 1989 British humorous animated short film of the same name.  The film matched animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes, making it appear as if the animals were being interviewed about their living conditions.  It was created by Nick Park and Aardman Animations.  The film later became the basis of a series of television advertisements for the electricity boards in the United Kingdom, and in 2003, a television series in the same style was released.  An American version of the series was also made. Tata Steel Zoological Park is situated in the corner most area of Jubilee Park.  This zoo is known for its Safari Park, which enables tourists to drive through the wooden area, where animals roam freely.  Tourists can also visit the Nature Education Centre in the zoo, which gives information about the zoo animals. Nicholas Wulstan \"Nick\" Park, CBE (born 6 December 1958) is an English director, writer and animator best known as the creator of \"Wallace and Gromit\" and \"Shaun the Sheep\".  Park has been nominated for an Academy Award a total of six times, and won four with \"Creature Comforts\" (1989), \"The Wrong Trousers\" (1993), \"A Close Shave\" (1995), and \"\" (2005). Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo is a platform video game, the first featuring Aardman Animations' characters Wallace & Gromit.  The game was developed by Frontier Developments for the PlayStation 2, Xbox (not compatible with Xbox 360), GameCube and Microsoft Windows.  The game features the voice of Wallace, Peter Sallis. Wallace and Gromit's World of Invention is a science-themed miniseries featuring the animated claymation characters Wallace and Gromit, made by Aardman and aired on BBC One.  The BBC said in a press statement that in the series, \"Wallace will take a light hearted and humorous look at the real-life inventors, contraptions, gadgets and inventions, with the silent help of Gromit.  The series aims to inspire a whole new generation of innovative minds by showing them real, but mind-boggling, machines and inventions from around the world that have influenced his illustrious inventing career.\" Exotic ungulate encephalopathy is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease, identified in infected organs of zoo animals.  This subgroup of the TSEs in captive animals was identified in zoo animals in Great Britain including species of greater kudu, nyala, gemsbok, the common eland, Arabian and Scimitar Oryx, an Ankole-Watusi cow, and an American bison.  Studies indicate that transmission likely occurred via the consumption of feed supplemented with meat and bone meal, although some animals died after the British ban on ground offal in animal feed.  All animals died during the 1990s, with the last death occurring in 1998. Wallace and Gromit is a British clay animation comedy series created by Nick Park of Aardman Animations.  The series consists of four short films and a feature-length film.  The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, along with his companion Gromit, a silent yet loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic dog.  Wallace was originally voiced by veteran actor Peter Sallis, but as of 2011, this role has been passed on to Ben Whitehead.  Gromit remains silent, communicating only through means of facial expressions and body language. Wallace & Gromit's Musical Marvels (also known as Wallace & Gromit at the Proms) is the name of Prom 20 of the 2012 season of The BBC Proms, which features orchestral renditions of Julian Nott's theme from Wallace & Gromit and classical music set to scenes from the Wallace & Gromit films.  Wallace is performed by Ben Whitehead, the actor who performed Wallace in the episodic adventure game series, Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures.

    "query": "Lifestyle changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of media.  Media – films, television shows, magazines, and more recently, the Internet (i.e. self-written blogs and popular websites) are the main sources of lifestyle influence around the world.  Lifestyle changes include how people eat, dress, and communicate.  Celebrity endorsements are prevalent.  Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the wealthy and famous, whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement.  At the dawn of the media age, the newspaper, popular magazines like \"Life\", and TV allowed the general public glimpse lifestyles that before were only available to the imagination.  After its creation, the Internet became arguably the most powerful medium for spotting and influencing trends, not just by celebrities but by the average person.  The computer era has changed the way people obtain their news, perspectives and communication.  Magazines are still popular, but advertisers now often supply a web address where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide.  The average American household has two personal computers, making the Internet easily accessible.  The rise of user-generated content is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an online journal, whether personal or commercial, which might detail someone's experience in a new restaurant, a purchased item of clothing or knickknack, or a review to a film.  With the advent of the Android phone and its relative ease of uploading photos to social media sites such as Facebook, one can get an idea of how quickly an idea, pub review, or coveted object can be shared.  Advertisers have always been privy to the strength of word-of-mouth and have tapped into social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr to make their wares known.  Douglas Kellner writes, \"Radio, television, film, and the other products of media culture provide materials out of which we forge our very identities; our sense of selfhood; our notion of what it means to be male or female; our sense of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, of sexuality; and of \"us\" and \"them.\"\" In describing the customs of the Mayas inhabiting the Verapaz province (including the Alta Verapaz and Baja Verapaz) of 16th-century Guatemala, Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas mentions sexual relationships, regulated by customary law, between unmarried young men and boys, as well as similar relations prevailing among adolescents receiving instruction in the temples.  Chin, together with Cu, Cavil ('idol'), and Maran, is mentioned as the name of the male deity said to have demonstrated sexual intercourse with another 'demon', and thereby to have introduced such relationships: \"From that time on some fathers gave their sons a little boy to be used as a woman; and if someone else took the boy, they demanded pay as is done when someone violates another's wife.\"  Institutionalized pederastic prostitution, including transvestism, is recorded in 17th-century Spanish reports of the Itzá Mayas living in the Petén.  Among the Classic Period scenes found in a cave of Naj Tunich is a depiction of a naked, sexually excited male creature embracing a nude Maya nobleman, possibly by way of initiation. Be Love is a Japanese manga magazine targeting women published by Kodansha.  It debuted in September 1980.  It is one of the leading manga magazines for adult women, the first of its kind, and was instrumental in the rising popularity of josei manga in the 1980s, which led to the creation of other magazines targeted at women such as \"You\" and \"Big Comic for Lady\".  As of 2003, \"Be Love\", like \"You\" and \"Jour\", published stories focussing on \"the reality of everyday life\" experienced by its readers. Whit Burnett (1900–1972) was an American writer and writing teacher who founded and edited the literary magazine \"Story\".  In the 1940s, \"Story\" was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors.  Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent, but \"Story\" remained a respectable though low-paying (typically $25 per story) alternative for stories rejected by the large-circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like \"Collier's\" or \"The Saturday Evening Post\" or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as \"The New Yorker\".  While \"Story\" paid poorly compared to the slicks and even the pulps and successor digest-sized magazines of its day, it paid better than most of, and had similar cachet to, the university-based and the other independent \"little magazines\" of its era. Kathoey or katoey (Thai: กะเทย ; rtgs: \"Kathoei\"  ] ) is a transgender woman or an effeminate gay male in Thailand.  A significant number of Thais perceive \"kathoeys\" as belonging to a third gender, including many \"kathoeys\" themselves, while others see them as either a kind of man or a kind of woman.  However, when considering transgender women (MtF) as a group in Thai society, most refer to themselves as \"phuying\" (Thai: ผู้หญิง \"women\"), with a minority referring to themselves as \"phuying praphet song\" (a \"second kind of woman\") and only very few referring to themselves as \"kathoey\".  Related phrases include \"phet thi sam\" (Thai: เพศที่สาม , \"third gender\"), and \"sao praphet song\" or \"phu ying praphet song\" (Thai: สาวประเภทสอง, ผู้หญิงประเภทสอง — both meaning \"second-type female\").  The word \"kathoey\" is of Khmer origin.  It is most often rendered as ladyboy or lady boy in English conversation with Thais and this latter expression has become popular across Southeast Asia. Pornographic magazines, or erotic magazines, sometimes known as adult, sex or top-shelf magazines, are magazines that contain content of an explicitly sexual nature.  Publications of this kind may contain images of attractive naked subjects, as is the case in softcore pornography, and, in the usual case of hardcore pornography, depictions of masturbation, oral or anal sex, or intercourse. Naj is a Polish language fortnightly lifestyle and women's magazine published in Warsaw, Poland. A roller disco is a discothèque or skating rink where all the dancers wear roller skates of some kind (traditional quad or inline).  The music played is modern and easily danceable, historically disco but in modern times including almost any form of dance, pop or rock music.  The concept originated as a fad in the 1970s when the disco craze was at its height, peaking around 1980 and inspiring several roller-disco magazines.  In 1984 the fad arrived in the United Kingdom and many roller discos popped up all over the country s of 2006 , the craze has largely discontinued, although many 1970s era roller-discos are still open and successful.  Also, it experienced a mild revival in the early 2000s, especially in the mid-eastern United States , where certain clubs continue to host roller disco nights.  Some now use in-line roller-blades.  Roller discos are also popular among older children and young teenagers, especially for parties.  As in other discos, special effects such as fog machines and flashing traffic lights are often used.  To minimise the risk of injury, the organisers of roller discos often only allow participants to skate in one direction at a time, so that they do not crash into one another, although many roller discos have a \"free skate\" section in the middle of the roller rink. The Alternative press in Nigeria or the press of the third kind is made up of writers who use militant approaches or viewpoints in news coverage.  This usually encompasses guerrilla journalism, a term credited to some Nigerian news magazines for their radical and militant rhetoric and writings usually against the military regimes of the 1990s.  The magazines consider themselves to be the last vestige of the common man and viewed certain military governments as usurpers of the people's dreams and yearnings.  These magazines are known for their belligerent assault on national leadership and use of secret offices, sometimes called bush offices to print their publications.  Some critics have raised ethnic nationalism and cultural coloration as key factors which provided the impetus for most of the rhetoric. Woman's Era is a fortnightly women interest magazine published in English in India.  It was started in 1973 by Vishwanath under his publishing house, the Delhi Press.

    "query": "Prince Hamlet is the title character and protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Hamlet\".  He is the Prince of Denmark, nephew to the usurping Claudius, and son of King Hamlet, the previous King of Denmark.  At the beginning of the play, he struggles with whether, and how, to avenge the murder of his father, and struggles with his own sanity along the way.  By the end of the tragedy, Hamlet has caused the deaths of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and two acquaintances of his from the University of Wittenberg Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and of his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake). Macbeth ( ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606.  It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake.  Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, \"Macbeth\" most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.  It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. Revenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England.  Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\" which characterizes revenge tragedy \"as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself.\"  Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage.  However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including \"Troas\" (1559), \"Thyestes\" (1560), and \"Hercules Furens\" (1561).  Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to \"The Spanish Tragedy\").  Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602) and \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606). Romeo Montague (Italian: \"Romeo Montecchi\" ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".  The son of Montague and his wife, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet.  Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death. Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare.  Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as \"histories\" in the First Folio.  The Roman tragedies—\"Julius Caesar\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and \"Coriolanus\"—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories.  Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy.  They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies.  Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the \"problem play,\" for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending.  The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars. Rory Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\".  Having been introduced at the start of the 5th series, Rory joins the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) as a companion in the middle of Series 5.  As Amy Pond's fiancé, Rory is initially insecure because he believes Amy secretly loves the Doctor more.  Later, however, he proves to be a hero in his own right and he and Amy marry.  The couple conceive a daughter aboard the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, while in the time vortex, but their baby is kidnapped at birth.  In \"A Good Man Goes to War\", Rory and Amy discover their time-traveler friend River Song is actually their daughter Melody Pond.  The Doctor and River marry in \"The Wedding of River Song\", and Rory becomes the Doctor's father-in-law. Romeo and Juliet is a 1954 film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name.  It was directed by Renato Castellani and stars Laurence Harvey as Romeo, Susan Shentall as Juliet, Flora Robson as the Nurse, Mervyn Johns as Friar Laurence, Bill Travers as Benvolio, Sebastian Cabot as Lord Capulet, Ubaldo Zollo as Mercutio, Enzo Fiermonte as Tybalt and John Gielgud as the Chorus. Juliet Capulet (Italian: \"Giulietta Capuleti\" ) is the female protagonist in William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".  Juliet is the only daughter of the patriarch of the House of Capulet and falls in love with Romeo, a member of the House of Montague (with which the Capulets have a blood feud).  The story has a long history that precedes Shakespeare himself. Anna Devane is a fictional character from the original ABC Daytime soap opera, \"General Hospital\", played by Finola Hughes.  Hughes also appeared as Anna on \"All My Children\", and the \"General Hospital\" prime time, spin-off series, \"\".  The character first appeared on the April 10, 1985 episode of \"General Hospital\" as a fence.  The character was created and introduced by executive producer, Gloria Monty, and co-head writers, Pat Falken Smith and Norma Monty.  Upon her introduction, Anna is revealed to be the super spy ex-wife of Robert Scorpio and romantic rival to his current wife, Holly Sutton.  Anna remained a prominent character in the series until 1992 due to her romantic pairings with Robert and former mobster, Duke Lavery.  The storyline in which Duke tries to evade his criminal past with the Jerome family, allows for Duke and Anna to become one of the show's supercouples, along with Robert and Anna.  However, the storyline ends in tragedy when Duke dies in Anna's arms.  Robert and Anna eventually reunite to raise their daughter, Robin, and eventually remarry; the happiness is short lived and the duo are killed off in 1992 along with their rival, Cesar Faison.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest football players in Michigan history.  He was selected by \"Sports Illustrated\" as the fourth greatest athlete in the history of the U.S. state of Michigan in 2003 and one of the eleven greatest college football players of the first century of the game (ending in 1968). Carey Alvin Spicer, Jr. (April 23, 1909 – December 5, 1996) was a two-time All-American basketball player at the University of Kentucky.  He captained Adolph Rupp's first team in 1930-31, and became Rupp's first All-American.  He was also an All-Conference Quarterback for the football team who played varsity tennis and ran track.  Rupp called him \"one of the greatest athletes in University of Kentucky history.\" Rufus Sisson (September 11, 1890 – March 1977) was an All-American basketball player at Dartmouth College in 1911–12.  He led the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League in scoring at 12.8 points per game in 10 games played.  He was the first Dartmouth player to lead the league in scoring, and only the second All-American (George Grebenstein was named an All-American in 1906). Jack Harvey (August 6, 1918 – November 1981) was an All-American basketball forward/center at the University of Colorado from 1937 to 1940.  As a senior in 1939–40, Harvey became the first Buffaloes basketball player to earn a Consensus All-American distinction when he garnered a Second Team accolade.

    "query": "Opry Mills is a super-regional shopping mall owned by Simon Property Group, formerly by its initial owners Mills Corporation and Gaylord Entertainment.  It opened in Nashville, Tennessee in 2000 on the former site of the Opryland USA theme park. The Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country-music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee, which was founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio \"barn dance\" on WSM.  Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history, albeit not the longest-running one on a radio network.  Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits.  It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners. Keith Bilbrey (born August 14, 1952) is an American country music disc jockey and television host in Nashville, Tennessee.  He served as a disc jockey at Nashville's WSM, as an announcer on the Grand Ole Opry, and as the host of TNN’s Grand Ole Opry Live. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important. Ryman Auditorium (formerly Grand Ole Opry House and Union Gospel Tabernacle) is a 2,362-seat live performance venue, located at 116 5th Avenue North, in Nashville, Tennessee and is best known as the home of the \"Grand Ole Opry\" from 1943 to 1974.  It is owned and operated by Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. The Bailey Brothers and the Happy Valley Boys were an American bluegrass act widely considered to be among the first to cultivate the duo harmony vocal technique widely used in modern bluegrass music today.  Charlie Bailey (February 11, 1916 in Happy Valley, Tennessee, near Rogersville – March 12, 2004 in Bear, Delaware) began his musical career in 1936.  His brother, Danny Bailey (December 1, 1919, Happy Valley, Tennessee – March 22, 2004, Knoxville, Tennessee), teamed up with him in 1940, and the brothers began making frequent appearances on Tennessee radio stations in the Knoxville area.  Danny formed the Happy Valley Boys after Charlie joined the military in 1941.  In 1944 the Happy Valley Boys relocated to Nashville, where they became members of the Grand Ole Opry, and also made regular appearances on WSM radio in Nashville.  At that time, Danny was the youngest person to ever perform on the Grand Ole Opry.  When Charlie returned from his military service in 1946 the brothers were reunited as a duo but only stayed in Nashville briefly before returning to radio work in Knoxville.

    "generated_text": "Opry Mills is a super-regional shopping mall owned by Simon Property Group, formerly by its initial owners Mills Corporation and Gaylord Entertainment.  It opened in Nashville, Tennessee in 2000 on the former site of the Opryland USA theme park. The Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country-music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee, which was founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio \"barn dance\" on WSM.  Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history, albeit not the longest-running one on a radio network.  Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits.  It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners. Keith Bilbrey (born August 14, 1952) is an American country music disc jockey and television host in Nashville, Tennessee.  He served as a disc jockey at Nashville's WSM, as an announcer on the Grand Ole Opry, and as the host of TNN’s Grand Ole Opry Live. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important. Ryman Auditorium (formerly Grand Ole Opry House and Union Gospel Tabernacle) is a 2,362-seat live performance venue, located at 116 5th Avenue North, in Nashville, Tennessee and is best known as the home of the \"Grand Ole Opry\" from 1943 to 1974.

The Bailey Brothers and the Happy Valley Boys were an American bluegrass act widely considered to be among the first to cultivate the duo harmony vocal technique widely used in modern bluegrass music today.  Charlie Bailey (February 11, 1916 in Happy Valley, Tennessee, near Rogersville – March 12, 2004 in Bear, Delaware) began his musical career in 1936.  His brother, Danny Bailey (December 1, 1919, Happy Valley, Tennessee – March 22, 2004, Knoxville, Tennessee), teamed up with him in 1940, and the brothers began making frequent appearances on Tennessee radio stations in the Knoxville area.  Danny formed the Happy Valley Boys after Charlie joined the military in 1941.  In 1944 the Happy Valley Boys relocated to Nashville, where they became members of the Grand Ole Opry, and also made regular appearances on WSM radio in Nashville.  At that time, Danny was the youngest person to ever perform on the Grand Ole Opry.  When Charlie returned from his military service in 1946 the brothers were reunited as a duo but only stayed in Nashville briefly before returning to radio work in Knoxville.

World Cup 98 (known in Europe as FIFA World Cup 98) is the first official FIFA World Cup game developed by EA Sports after obtaining the rights from FIFA in 1997.  Unlike the previous World Cup games, which were in 2D and showed a bird's-eye view, \"World Cup 98\" was the first in the franchise to use a 3D engine, utilising DirectX for the PC version.  Accurate national team kits (except for the goalkeepers who were issued a generic kit) were introduced complete with kit manufacturer logos and official merchandise.  The game engine is based on that of \"\", though it features some minor gameplay improvements to areas such as ingame strategy changing and player positioning.  The playable teams in the friendly mode also included several nations that did not qualify for the finals.  \"World Cup 98\" was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy. The Tunisia national football team (Arabic: منتخب تونس لكرة القدم‎ ‎ ), nicknamed \"Les Aigles de Carthage (The Eagles of Carthage or The Carthage Eagles)\", is the national team of Tunisia and is controlled by the Tunisian Football Federation.  They have qualified for four FIFA World Cups, the first one in 1978, but have yet to make it out of the first round.

He did not finish the first run of his other four races in 2008.  In fact it was over a year until Vogel picked up his first World Cup points with a 19th-place finish in Kitzbühel.  The 2010 season was another disappointing one, with Vogel spending most of his time in FIS Races and European Cup level.  After this period, Vogel came back strongly at the end of the next season and earned himself a place in the Swiss World Championship team in 2011.

So far three nations have won the competition (Australia ten times, Great Britain three times and New Zealand once).  Australia, France and New Zealand are the only teams to have played in all tournaments (Great Britain has been split into England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland since 1995, while England and Wales had previously competed as separate teams in the 1975 World Cup).  Since 2000, the RLIF has also organised World Cups for women, students and other categories.  The 2013 Rugby League World Cup was held in England and Wales and won by Australia. The Australian cricket team is the most successful team in the Cricket World Cup winning the 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015 editions.  This also makes them the only team to have won the world cup in all the regions (group of countries) that have hosted the world cup till now.  Besides, Australia had reached the finals of the 1975 and 1996 World cups losing to West Indies and Sri Lanka respectively.

World Cup 98 (known in Europe as FIFA World Cup 98) is the first official FIFA World Cup game developed by EA Sports after obtaining the rights from FIFA in 1997.  Unlike the previous World Cup games, which were in 2D and showed a bird's-eye view, \"World Cup 98\" was the first in the franchise to use a 3D engine, utilising DirectX for the PC version.  Accurate national team kits (except for the goalkeepers who were issued a generic kit) were introduced complete with kit manufacturer logos and official merchandise.  The game engine is based on that of \"\", though it features some minor gameplay improvements to areas such as ingame strategy changing and player positioning.  The playable teams in the friendly mode also included several nations that did not qualify for the finals.  \"World Cup 98\" was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy. The Tunisia national football team (Arabic: منتخب تونس لكرة القدم‎ ‎ ), nicknamed \"Les Aigles de Carthage (The Eagles of Carthage or The Carthage Eagles)\", is the national team of Tunisia and is controlled by the Tunisian Football Federation.  They have qualified for four FIFA World Cups, the first one in 1978, but have yet to make it out of the first round.  Nevertheless, they created history in that 1978 tournament in Argentina by becoming the first African side to win a World Cup match, beating Mexico 3–1.  They also held defending champions West Germany to a goalless draw before bowing out.  They have since qualified for the three tournaments in succession, in 1998, 2002 and 2006: they were the only African team to appear at both the 2002 and 2006 tournaments.

He did not finish the first run of his other four races in 2008.  In fact it was over a year until Vogel picked up his first World Cup points with a 19th-place finish in Kitzbühel.

The Rugby League World Cup is an international rugby league tournament, contested by national teams of the Rugby League International Federation, which was first held in France in 1954, the first World Cup in either rugby code.  The idea of a rugby league world cup tournament was first mooted in the 1930s with the French proposing holding a tournament in 1931, and again in 1951.  The fourteen tournaments held to date have been at intervals ranging from two to eight years, and have featured a number of different formats.  So far three nations have won the competition (Australia ten times, Great Britain three times and New Zealand once).  Australia, France and New Zealand are the only teams to have played in all tournaments (Great Britain has been split into England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland since 1995, while England and Wales had previously competed as separate teams in the 1975 World Cup).  Since 2000, the RLIF has also organised World Cups for women, students and other categories.  The 2013 Rugby League World Cup was held in England and Wales and won by Australia. The Australian cricket team is the most successful team in the Cricket World Cup winning the 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015 editions.  This also makes them the only team to have won the world cup in all the regions (group of countries) that have hosted the world cup till now.  Besides, Australia had reached the finals of the 1975 and 1996 World cups losing to West Indies and Sri Lanka respectively.  They also reached quarterfinals of 2011 Cricket World Cup, and were knocked out in first round three times : 1979, 1983 and 1992.  Though they have won world cup record five times, they are also the only team considered as tournament favorites for every world cup, right from 1975 to present.  The team has played total 85 world cup matches, the highest of any team.  Its overall win-loss record is 61-21 (which gives it the highest win percentage among all teams playing the world cup), with one tied match and two being abandoned due to rain. Olle Nordin (born 23 November 1949 in Delary, Småland) is a Swedish football coach and former player.  He was capped 19 times for the national team and played at the 1978 FIFA World Cup, but he is best remembered for his coaching merits.  As national team coach, he led Sweden to the 1990 FIFA World Cup — its first World Cup since Nordin participated as a player.  The tournament was a failure, however, as Sweden lost all three matches with 1-2.  Nordin was fired shortly thereafter.  He managed Norwegian clubs (Vålerenga, Lyn) as well as Swedish Västra Frölunda IF, IFK Norrköping and AIK.Sadok Sassi played for a national team that made its first World Cup in what year?

He died in his home town of Stratford on 23 April 1616 at the age of 52.  Though more is known about Shakespeare's life than those of most other Elizabethan and Jacobean writers, few personal biographical facts survive about him, which is unsurprising in the light of his social status as a commoner, the low esteem in which his profession was held, and the general lack of interest of the time in the personal lives of writers.  Information about his life derives from public instead of private documents: vital records, real estate and tax records, lawsuits, records of payments, and references to Shakespeare and his works in printed and hand-written texts.  Nevertheless, hundreds of biographies have been written and more continue to be, most of which rely on inferences and the historical context of the 70 or so hard facts recorded about Shakespeare the man, a technique that sometimes leads to embellishment or unwarranted interpretation of the documented record. The Holy Sonnets—also known as the Divine Meditations or Divine Sonnets—are a series of nineteen poems by the English poet John Donne (1572–1631).  The sonnets were first published in 1633—two years after Donne's death.  The poems are sonnets and are predominantly in the style and form prescribed by Renaissance Italian poet Petrarch (or Francesco Petrarca) (1304–1374) in which the sonnet consisted of two quatrains (four-line stanzas) and a sestet (a six-line stanza).  However, several rhythmic and structural patterns as well as the inclusion of couplets are elements influenced by the sonnet form developed by English poet and playwright William Shakespeare (1564–1616). William Shakespeare ( ; 26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.  He is often called England's national poet, and the \"Bard of Avon\".  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.  His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.This term about a playwright who lived from 1564-1616 presented what about his works?

The album peaked at #2 in her native Sweden, and the two singles \"Keep This Fire Burning\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\" were both top 10 hits.  In 2003, \"Don't Stop The Music\" was certified platinum by IFPI, and has sold over 60,000 copies in Sweden. \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" is a 1966 song written and composed by Holland–Dozier–Holland.  It first became a popular \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one hit for the American Motown group The Supremes in late 1966.  The rock band Vanilla Fudge covered the song a year later and had a top ten hit with their version.  British pop singer Kim Wilde covered \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" in 1986, bumping it back to number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in June 1987.  The single reached number one by two different musical acts in America.  In the first 32 years of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 rock era, “You Keep Me Hangin' On” became one of only six songs to achieve this feat.  In 1996, country music singer Reba McEntire's version reached number 2 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart. American entertainer Madonna has released 68 music videos, 11 concert tour videos, 2 documentary videos, 4 music video compilations, 2 music video box sets, 4 promotional videos, and 5 video singles.  In 1982, Madonna signed a recording contract with Sire Records and released her first two singles before launching her eponymous debut album.  Her first video to receive attention on MTV was \"Borderline\", followed by \"Lucky Star\" and \"Like a Virgin\", which popularized Madonna's image and fashion among younger generation.  Her early videos were released commercially on \"Madonna\" (1984), which became the best-selling videocassette of 1985.  With the title track from her third studio album \"True Blue\" (1986), Madonna's impact on MTV and popular music was established when a contest entitled \"Making My Video\", was held to create a music video for the song. \" La Isla Bonita\" and \"Who's That Girl\", both released in 1987, showed Madonna's fascination with Hispanic culture and religious symbolism.  In 1989, the video of \"Like a Prayer\" portrayed her dancing in front of burning crosses, receiving stigmata, kissing a black saint and having sex with him in a church altar.  It faced strong reaction from religious groups and media. \" Express Yourself\" released the same year was critically appreciated for its positive feminist themes.

It was later covered by British soul singer Beverley Knight. \"Keep This Fire Burning\" is a song by Swedish pop singer Robyn, released as the first single from her third album \"Don't Stop the Music\".  It was released in Sweden on September 21, 2002, where it became her highest charting single since 1995's \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\".  The song was also released as a single in Australia under the name \"By Your Side\", due to the Australian bush fires which were happening at the time.  In 2008, a re-recorded version of the song appeared on the special edition of Robyn's eponymous album. \"I'll Keep the Lovelight Burning\" is a popular song written in 1942 by Harry Tobias, Nick Kenny, and Harold Levey, popularized by Patti Page in 1949.

William Ford Gibson (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian speculative fiction writer and essayist widely credited with pioneering the science fiction subgenre known as cyberpunk.  Beginning his writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were noir, near-future stories that explored the effects of technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humans—a \"combination of lowlife and high tech\"—and helped to create an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.  Gibson notably coined the term \"cyberspace\" in his short story \"Burning Chrome\" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel \"Neuromancer\" (1984).  These early works have been credited with \"renovating\" science fiction literature after it had fallen largely into insignificance in the 1970s.

She was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade long career.  She was often introduced as \"the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page\".  New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as \"A Page in my life called Patti\". Burning the clavie is an ancient Scottish custom still observed at Burghead, a fishing village on the Moray Firth.  The \"clavie\" is a collection of casks split in two, lit as a bonfire in the evening of 11 January, i.e. New Year's Eve (in Scotland, Hogmanay) by the Julian Calendar.  One of these casks is joined together again by a huge nail (Latin \"clavis\"; hence the term, it may also be from Scottish Gaelic \"cliabh\", a basket used for holding combustibles).  It is then filled with tar, lighted and carried flaming round the village and finally up to a headland upon which stands the ruins of an altar, locally called the \"Doorie\".  It here forms the nucleus of the bonfire, which is built up of split casks.
