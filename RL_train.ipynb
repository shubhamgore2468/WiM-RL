    "#  'segment': 'Ed Wood is a 1994 American biographical period comedy-drama film directed and produced by Tim Burton, and starring Johnny Depp as cult filmmaker Ed Wood.  The film concerns the period in Wood\\'s life when he made his best-known films as well as his relationship with actor Bela Lugosi, played by Martin Landau.  Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, Lisa Marie, and Bill Murray are among the supporting cast. Scott Derrickson (born July 16, 1966) is an American director, screenwriter and producer.  He lives in Los Angeles, California.  He is best known for directing horror films such as \"Sinister\", \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\", and \"Deliver Us From Evil\", as well as the 2016 Marvel Cinematic Universe installment, \"Doctor Strange.\" Woodson is a census-designated place (CDP) in Pulaski County, Arkansas, in the United States.  Its population was 403 at the 2010 census.  It is part of the Little Rock–North Little Rock–Conway Metropolitan Statistical Area.  Woodson and its accompanying Woodson Lake and Wood Hollow are the namesake for Ed Wood Sr., a prominent plantation owner, trader, and businessman at the turn of the 20th century.  Woodson is adjacent to the Wood Plantation, the largest of the plantations own by Ed Wood Sr. Tyler Bates (born June 5, 1965) is an American musician, music producer, and composer for films, television, and video games.  Much of his work is in the action and horror film genres, with films like \"Dawn of the Dead, 300, Sucker Punch,\" and \"John Wick.\"  He has collaborated with directors like Zack Snyder, Rob Zombie, Neil Marshall, William Friedkin, Scott Derrickson, and James Gunn.  With Gunn, he has scored every one of the director\\'s films; including \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", which became one of the highest grossing domestic movies of 2014, and its 2017 sequel.  In addition, he is also the lead guitarist of the American rock band Marilyn Manson, and produced its albums \"The Pale Emperor\" and \"Heaven Upside Down\". Edward Davis Wood Jr. (October 10, 1924 – December 10, 1978) was an American filmmaker, actor, writer, producer, and director. Deliver Us from Evil is a 2014 American supernatural horror film directed by Scott Derrickson and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.  The film is officially based on a 2001 non-fiction book entitled \"Beware the Night\" by Ralph Sarchie and Lisa Collier Cool, and its marketing campaign highlighted that it was \"inspired by actual accounts\".  The film stars Eric Bana, Édgar Ramírez, Sean Harris, Olivia Munn, and Joel McHale in the main roles and was released on July 2, 2014. Adam Collis is an American filmmaker and actor.  He attended the Duke University from 1986 to 1990 and the University of California, Los Angeles from 2007 to 2010.  He also studied cinema at the University of Southern California from 1991 to 1997.  Collis first work was the assistant director for the Scott Derrickson\\'s short \"Love in the Ruins\" (1995).  In 1998, he played \"Crankshaft\" in Eric Koyanagi\\'s \"Hundred Percent\". Sinister is a 2012 supernatural horror film directed by Scott Derrickson and written by Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill.  It stars Ethan Hawke as fictional true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt who discovers a box of home movies in his attic that puts his family in danger. Conrad Brooks (born Conrad Biedrzycki on January 3, 1931 in Baltimore, Maryland) is an American actor.  He moved to Hollywood, California in 1948 to pursue a career in acting.  He got his start in movies appearing in Ed Wood films such as \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", \"Glen or Glenda\", and \"Jail Bait.\"  He took a break from acting during the 1960s and 1970s but due to the ongoing interest in the films of Ed Wood, he reemerged in the 1980s and has become a prolific actor.  He also has since gone on to write, produce and direct several films. Doctor Strange is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.  It is the fourteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).  The film was directed by Scott Derrickson, who wrote it with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange, along with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt, Scott Adkins, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tilda Swinton.

      "context: Peter Doherty (born 12 March 1979) is an English musician, songwriter, actor, poet, writer, and artist.  He is best known for being co-frontman of the Libertines, which he formed with Carl Barât in 1997.  His other musical projects are indie band Babyshambles and Peter Doherty and the Puta Madres. Relativity is the debut album by American post-hardcore band Emarosa released on July 8, 2008 through Rise Records.  \"Relativity\" was produced by Kris Crummett, producer of other bands such as Drop Dead, Gorgeous and Fear Before, whom Jonny Craig worked with on Dance Gavin Dance's debut album the year before. Jonathan Monroe \"Jonny\" Craig (born March 26, 1986) is a Canadian-American singer and songwriter.  He is currently working as a solo musician.  He has been the lead vocalist for the bands Dance Gavin Dance, Emarosa, Ghost Runner on Third, Slaves, and westerHALTS.  As a solo artist, he has released one studio album, two EPs and a live album to date.  He was also a part of the supergroup Isles & Glaciers.  Craig possesses the vocal range of a baritenor and his distinct type of soul-based singing has earned him considerable acclaim. Up the Shambles – Live in Manchester is a live DVD of the band Babyshambles.  The DVD was released without the bands prior knowledge according to bassist Drew McConnell.  The DVD was released around the time of the band's second album \"Shotters Nation\", but not only featured a much older version of the band, it was recorded prior to the release of the first album \"Down in Albion\".  The set list features not only songs on the band's debut but B-sides, unreleased songs and songs by Pete Doherty's former band The Libertines. The Libertines are an English rock band, formed in London in 1997 by frontmen Carl Barât (vocals/guitar) and Pete Doherty (vocals/guitar).  The band, centred on the songwriting partnership of Barât and Doherty, has also included John Hassall (bass) and Gary Powell (drums) for most of its recording career.  The band was part of the garage rock revival and spearheaded the movement in the UK. Paul Nicholas Roundhill (born 25 March 1955 in London) is an English artist and writer based in the East End of London, England.  He is best known for his association with musician Pete Doherty, acting as his self-styled literary agent and previously running the website balachada.com (Bala Chadha being street slang for crack cocaine from the Bengali translation of \"good white\"), which was closed by Doherty in May 2006. The Books of Albion, or Journals: The Collected Writings of Peter Doherty, is an anthology of the poetry and diary entries of English musician and poet Pete Doherty.  He is also currently a member of the group Babyshambles but is most known for his time as front man of The Libertines.  The book has writings from 1999 up until 2007 and was released on the 30 May 2007 by Orion Books. Dirty Pretty Things were an English band fronted by Carl Barât, a member of The Libertines.  The formation of the band was announced in September 2005, after a dispute between Barât and Pete Doherty led to the breakup of The Libertines in 2004.  Barât had worked with Vertigo Records and had previously revealed that his new project was with the label.  Didz Hammond announced he was leaving the Cooper Temple Clause to join the band alongside Libertines drummer Gary Powell and guitarist Anthony Rossomando, who had filled in for Doherty following his departure from The Libertines.  They played their first shows in October 2005 in Italy and Paris, France.  They announced their split on 1 October 2008 and played their final shows during November. Stalking Pete Doherty is a rockumentary assembled from footage shot by Max Carlish, a BAFTA Award–winning film director.  As the title suggests, it is about both attempts by Carlish to interview Pete Doherty. The Greatest of All Lost Arts is the second album by the American post-hardcore band Lower Definition.  The album was recorded in early 2008 with producer Kris Crummett and was released on July 8.  The album contains 11 tracks, with Jonny Craig providing guest vocals on \"Pueblo Cicada\".

      "context: The Compromise of 1790 was a compromise between Alexander Hamilton on the one hand and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison whereby Hamilton won the decision for the national government to take over and pay the state debts, while Jefferson and Madison obtained the national capital (District of Columbia) for the South.  The compromise resolved the deadlock in Congress.  Southerners were blocking the assumption of state debts by the treasury, thereby destroying the Hamiltonian program for building a fiscally strong nation state.  Northerners rejected the proposal, much desired by Virginians, to locate the permanent national capital on the Virginia-Maryland border.  The compromise made possible the passage of the Residence and Funding (Assumption) Acts in July and August 1790.  Historian Jacob Cooke says it is, \"generally regarded as one of the most important bargains in American history, ranking just below the better known Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850.\" The Anti-Nebraska movement was a political alignment in the United States formed in opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 and to its repeal of the Missouri Compromise provision forbidding slavery in U.S. territories north of latitude 36° 30' N.  (At the time, the name \"Nebraska\" could loosely refer to areas west of the Missouri River.) The Republican Party, also commonly called the GOP (for \"Grand Old Party\"), is one of the world's oldest extant political parties.  It is the second oldest existing political party in the United States after its primary rival, the Democratic Party.  It emerged in 1854 to combat the Kansas–Nebraska Act, an act that dissolved the terms of the Missouri Compromise and allowed slave or free status to be decided in the territories by popular sovereignty.  The Party had almost no presence in the Southern United States, but by 1858 in the North it had enlisted former Whigs and former Free Soil Democrats to form majorities in nearly every Northern state. William King (February 9, 1768June 17, 1852) was an American merchant, shipbuilder, army officer, and statesman from Bath, Maine.  A proponent of statehood for Maine, he became its first governor when it separated from Massachusetts in 1820. Henry Smith Lane (February 24, 1811 – June 19, 1881) was a United States Representative, Senator, and the 13th Governor of Indiana; he was by design the shortest-serving Governor of Indiana, having made plans to resign the office should his party take control of the Indiana General Assembly and elect him to the United States Senate.  He held that office for only two days, and was known for his opposition to slavery.  A Whig until the party collapsed, he supported compromise with the south.  He became an early leader in the Republican Party starting in 1856 serving as the president of the first party convention, delivering its keynote address, and was influential in the nomination of Abraham Lincoln.  With the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, he became a full-fledged The parallel 36°30′ north is a circle of latitude that is 36 and one-half degrees north of the equator of the Earth.  This parallel of latitude is particularly significant in the history of the United States as the line of the Missouri Compromise, which was used to divide the prospective slave and free states west of the Mississippi River, with the exception of Missouri, which is mostly north of this parallel. The 1820 Maine gubernatorial election took place on April 3, 1820.  It was the first election for Governor of Maine, taking place after Maine separated from Massachusetts and was recognized as a state on March 15, 1820.  Maine's separation from Massachusetts came as a result of The Missouri Compromise.  This election saw the virtually unanimous election of William King, the man most chiefly responsible for the push for Maine statehood.  He had no opponents. The Pottawatomie massacre occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856.  In reaction to the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas by pro-slavery forces, John Brown and a band of abolitionist settlers—some of them members of the Pottawatomie Rifles—killed five settlers north of Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas.  This was one of the many bloody episodes in Kansas preceding the American Civil War, which came to be known collectively as Bleeding Kansas.  Bleeding Kansas was largely brought about by the Missouri Compromise and the Kansas–Nebraska Act. The Missouri Compromise is the title generally attached to the legislation passed by the 16th United States Congress on May 8, 1820.  The measures provided for the admission of Maine as a state along with Missouri as a slave state, thus maintaining the balance of power between North and South.  As part of the compromise, slavery was prohibited North of the 36°30′ parallel, excluding Missouri.  President James Monroe signed the legislation on April 6, 1820. Dred Scott (c. 1799 – September 17, 1858) was an enslaved African American man in the United States who unsuccessfully sued for his freedom and that of his wife and their two daughters in the \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" case of 1857, popularly known as the \"Dred Scott Decision\".  Scott claimed that he and his wife should be granted their freedom because they had lived in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory for four years, where slavery was illegal.  The United States Supreme Court decided 7–2 against Scott, finding that neither he nor any other person of African ancestry could claim citizenship in the United States, and therefore Scott could not bring suit in federal court under diversity of citizenship rules.  Moreover, Scott's temporary residence outside Missouri did not bring about his emancipation under the Missouri Compromise, which the court ruled unconstitutional as it would \"improperly deprive Scott's owner of his legal property\".\n",

      "segment: The Compromise of 1790 was a compromise between Alexander Hamilton on the one hand and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison whereby Hamilton won the decision for the national government to take over and pay the state debts, while Jefferson and Madison obtained the national capital (District of Columbia) for the South. The compromise resolved the deadlock in Congress. Southerners were blocking the assumption of state debts by the treasury, thereby destroying the Hamiltonian program for building a fiscally strong nation state. Northerners rejected the proposal, much desired by Virginians, to locate the permanent national capital on the Virginia-Maryland border. The compromise made possible the passage of the Residence and Funding (Assumption) Acts in July and August 1790. Historian Jacob Cooke says it is, \"generally regarded as one of the most important bargains in American history, ranking just below the better known Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850.\" The Anti-Nebraska movement was a political alignment in the United States formed in opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 and to its repeal of the Missouri Compromise provision forbidding slavery in U.S. territories north of latitude 36° 30' N.

      "context: Creature Comforts is a stop motion clay animation comedy mockumentary franchise originating in a 1989 British humorous animated short film of the same name.  The film matched animated zoo animals with a soundtrack of people talking about their homes, making it appear as if the animals were being interviewed about their living conditions.  It was created by Nick Park and Aardman Animations.  The film later became the basis of a series of television advertisements for the electricity boards in the United Kingdom, and in 2003, a television series in the same style was released.  An American version of the series was also made. Tata Steel Zoological Park is situated in the corner most area of Jubilee Park.  This zoo is known for its Safari Park, which enables tourists to drive through the wooden area, where animals roam freely.  Tourists can also visit the Nature Education Centre in the zoo, which gives information about the zoo animals. Nicholas Wulstan \"Nick\" Park, CBE (born 6 December 1958) is an English director, writer and animator best known as the creator of \"Wallace and Gromit\" and \"Shaun the Sheep\".  Park has been nominated for an Academy Award a total of six times, and won four with \"Creature Comforts\" (1989), \"The Wrong Trousers\" (1993), \"A Close Shave\" (1995), and \"\" (2005). Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo is a platform video game, the first featuring Aardman Animations' characters Wallace & Gromit.  The game was developed by Frontier Developments for the PlayStation 2, Xbox (not compatible with Xbox 360), GameCube and Microsoft Windows.  The game features the voice of Wallace, Peter Sallis. Wallace and Gromit's World of Invention is a science-themed miniseries featuring the animated claymation characters Wallace and Gromit, made by Aardman and aired on BBC One.  The BBC said in a press statement that in the series, \"Wallace will take a light hearted and humorous look at the real-life inventors, contraptions, gadgets and inventions, with the silent help of Gromit.  The series aims to inspire a whole new generation of innovative minds by showing them real, but mind-boggling, machines and inventions from around the world that have influenced his illustrious inventing career.\" Exotic ungulate encephalopathy is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease, identified in infected organs of zoo animals.  This subgroup of the TSEs in captive animals was identified in zoo animals in Great Britain including species of greater kudu, nyala, gemsbok, the common eland, Arabian and Scimitar Oryx, an Ankole-Watusi cow, and an American bison.  Studies indicate that transmission likely occurred via the consumption of feed supplemented with meat and bone meal, although some animals died after the British ban on ground offal in animal feed.  All animals died during the 1990s, with the last death occurring in 1998. Wallace and Gromit is a British clay animation comedy series created by Nick Park of Aardman Animations.  The series consists of four short films and a feature-length film.  The series centres on Wallace, a good-natured, eccentric, cheese-loving inventor, along with his companion Gromit, a silent yet loyal and intelligent anthropomorphic dog.  Wallace was originally voiced by veteran actor Peter Sallis, but as of 2011, this role has been passed on to Ben Whitehead.  Gromit remains silent, communicating only through means of facial expressions and body language. Wallace & Gromit's Musical Marvels (also known as Wallace & Gromit at the Proms) is the name of Prom 20 of the 2012 season of The BBC Proms, which features orchestral renditions of Julian Nott's theme from Wallace & Gromit and classical music set to scenes from the Wallace & Gromit films.  Wallace is performed by Ben Whitehead, the actor who performed Wallace in the episodic adventure game series, Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures.  Due to its popularity, it became a full touring show in 2013, premiering at The Plenary in Melbourne, Australia on 9 February 2013. On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and was grabbed and dragged by Harambe, a 17-year-old Western lowland gorilla.  Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe.  The incident was recorded on video and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to kill Harambe.  A number of primatologists and conservationists wrote later that the zoo had no other choice under the circumstances, and that it highlighted the danger of zoo animals in close proximity to humans and the need for better standards of care.

      "context: Lifestyle changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of media.  Media – films, television shows, magazines, and more recently, the Internet (i.e. self-written blogs and popular websites) are the main sources of lifestyle influence around the world.  Lifestyle changes include how people eat, dress, and communicate.  Celebrity endorsements are prevalent.  Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the wealthy and famous, whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement.  At the dawn of the media age, the newspaper, popular magazines like \"Life\", and TV allowed the general public glimpse lifestyles that before were only available to the imagination.  After its creation, the Internet became arguably the most powerful medium for spotting and influencing trends, not just by celebrities but by the average person.  The computer era has changed the way people obtain their news, perspectives and communication.  Magazines are still popular, but advertisers now often supply a web address where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide.  The average American household has two personal computers, making the Internet easily accessible.  The rise of user-generated content is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an online journal, whether personal or commercial, which might detail someone's experience in a new restaurant, a purchased item of clothing or knickknack, or a review to a film.  With the advent of the Android phone and its relative ease of uploading photos to social media sites such as Facebook, one can get an idea of how quickly an idea, pub review, or coveted object can be shared.  Advertisers have always been privy to the strength of word-of-mouth and have tapped into social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr to make their wares known.  Douglas Kellner writes, \"Radio, television, film, and the other products of media culture provide materials out of which we forge our very identities; our sense of selfhood; our notion of what it means to be male or female; our sense of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, of sexuality; and of \"us\" and \"them.\"\" In describing the customs of the Mayas inhabiting the Verapaz province (including the Alta Verapaz and Baja Verapaz) of 16th-century Guatemala, Bishop Bartolomé de las Casas mentions sexual relationships, regulated by customary law, between unmarried young men and boys, as well as similar relations prevailing among adolescents receiving instruction in the temples.  Chin, together with Cu, Cavil ('idol'), and Maran, is mentioned as the name of the male deity said to have demonstrated sexual intercourse with another 'demon', and thereby to have introduced such relationships: \"From that time on some fathers gave their sons a little boy to be used as a woman; and if someone else took the boy, they demanded pay as is done when someone violates another's wife.\"  Institutionalized pederastic prostitution, including transvestism, is recorded in 17th-century Spanish reports of the Itzá Mayas living in the Petén.  Among the Classic Period scenes found in a cave of Naj Tunich is a depiction of a naked, sexually excited male creature embracing a nude Maya nobleman, possibly by way of initiation. Be Love is a Japanese manga magazine targeting women published by Kodansha.  It debuted in September 1980.  It is one of the leading manga magazines for adult women, the first of its kind, and was instrumental in the rising popularity of josei manga in the 1980s, which led to the creation of other magazines targeted at women such as \"You\" and \"Big Comic for Lady\".  As of 2003, \"Be Love\", like \"You\" and \"Jour\", published stories focussing on \"the reality of everyday life\" experienced by its readers. Whit Burnett (1900–1972) was an American writer and writing teacher who founded and edited the literary magazine \"Story\".  In the 1940s, \"Story\" was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors.  Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent, but \"Story\" remained a respectable though low-paying (typically $25 per story) alternative for stories rejected by the large-circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like \"Collier's\" or \"The Saturday Evening Post\" or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as \"The New Yorker\".  While \"Story\" paid poorly compared to the slicks and even the pulps and successor digest-sized magazines of its day, it paid better than most of, and had similar cachet to, the university-based and the other independent \"little magazines\" of its era. Kathoey or katoey (Thai: กะเทย ; rtgs: \"Kathoei\"  ] ) is a transgender woman or an effeminate gay male in Thailand.  A significant number of Thais perceive \"kathoeys\" as belonging to a third gender, including many \"kathoeys\" themselves, while others see them as either a kind of man or a kind of woman.  However, when considering transgender women (MtF) as a group in Thai society, most refer to themselves as \"phuying\" (Thai: ผู้หญิง \"women\"), with a minority referring to themselves as \"phuying praphet song\" (a \"second kind of woman\") and only very few referring to themselves as \"kathoey\".  Related phrases include \"phet thi sam\" (Thai: เพศที่สาม , \"third gender\"), and \"sao praphet song\" or \"phu ying praphet song\" (Thai: สาวประเภทสอง, ผู้หญิงประเภทสอง — both meaning \"second-type female\").  The word \"kathoey\" is of Khmer origin.  It is most often rendered as ladyboy or lady boy in English conversation with Thais and this latter expression has become popular across Southeast Asia. Pornographic magazines, or erotic magazines, sometimes known as adult, sex or top-shelf magazines, are magazines that contain content of an explicitly sexual nature.  Publications of this kind may contain images of attractive naked subjects, as is the case in softcore pornography, and, in the usual case of hardcore pornography, depictions of masturbation, oral or anal sex, or intercourse. Naj is a Polish language fortnightly lifestyle and women's magazine published in Warsaw, Poland. A roller disco is a discothèque or skating rink where all the dancers wear roller skates of some kind (traditional quad or inline).  The music played is modern and easily danceable, historically disco but in modern times including almost any form of dance, pop or rock music.  The concept originated as a fad in the 1970s when the disco craze was at its height, peaking around 1980 and inspiring several roller-disco magazines.  In 1984 the fad arrived in the United Kingdom and many roller discos popped up all over the country s of 2006 , the craze has largely discontinued, although many 1970s era roller-discos are still open and successful.  Also, it experienced a mild revival in the early 2000s, especially in the mid-eastern United States , where certain clubs continue to host roller disco nights.  Some now use in-line roller-blades.  Roller discos are also popular among older children and young teenagers, especially for parties.  As in other discos, special effects such as fog machines and flashing traffic lights are often used.  To minimise the risk of injury, the organisers of roller discos often only allow participants to skate in one direction at a time, so that they do not crash into one another, although many roller discos have a \"free skate\" section in the middle of the roller rink. The Alternative press in Nigeria or the press of the third kind is made up of writers who use militant approaches or viewpoints in news coverage.  This usually encompasses guerrilla journalism, a term credited to some Nigerian news magazines for their radical and militant rhetoric and writings usually against the military regimes of the 1990s.  The magazines consider themselves to be the last vestige of the common man and viewed certain military governments as usurpers of the people's dreams and yearnings.  These magazines are known for their belligerent assault on national leadership and use of secret offices, sometimes called bush offices to print their publications.  Some critics have raised ethnic nationalism and cultural coloration as key factors which provided the impetus for most of the rhetoric. Woman's Era is a fortnightly women interest magazine published in English in India.  It was started in 1973 by Vishwanath under his publishing house, the Delhi Press.  The magazine is owned by the Delhi Press.  Divesh Nath has been the managing editor of the magazine since 2002.\n",

Whit Burnett (1900–1972) was an American writer and writing teacher who founded and edited the literary magazine \"Story\". In the 1940s, \"Story\" was an important magazine in that it published the first or early works of many writers who went on to become major authors.\n",

      "segment: Not only did Burnett prove to be a valuable literary birddog for new talent, but \"Story\" remained a respectable though low-paying (typically $25 per story) alternative for stories rejected by the large-circulation slick magazines published on glossy paper like \"Collier's\" or \"The Saturday Evening Post\" or the somewhat more prestigious and literary slick magazines such as \"The New Yorker\". While \"Story\" paid poorly compared to the slicks and even the pulps and successor digest-sized magazines of its day, it paid better than most of, and had similar cachet to, the university-based and the other independent \"little magazines\" of its era. Kathoey or katoey (Thai: กะเทย ; rtgs: \"Kathoei\"  ] ) is a transgender woman or an effeminate gay male in Thailand. A significant number of Thais perceive \"kathoeys\" as belonging to a third gender, including many \"kathoeys\" themselves, while others see them as either a kind of man or a kind of woman. However, when considering transgender women (MtF) as a group in Thai society, most refer to themselves as \"phuying\" (Thai: ผู้หญิง \"women\"), with a minority referring to themselves as \"phuying praphet song\" (a \"second kind of woman\") and only very few referring to themselves as \"kathoey\". Related phrases include \"phet thi sam\" (Thai: เพศที่สาม , \"third gender\"), and \"sao praphet song\" or \"phu ying praphet song\" (Thai: สาวประเภทสอง, ผู้หญิงประเภทสอง — both meaning \"second-type female\"). The word \"kathoey\" is of Khmer origin. It is most often rendered as ladyboy or lady boy in English conversation with Thais and this latter expression has become popular across Southeast Asia. Pornographic magazines, or erotic magazines, sometimes known as adult, sex or top-shelf magazines, are magazines that contain content of an explicitly sexual nature. Publications of this kind may contain images of attractive naked subjects, as is the case in softcore pornography, and, in the usual case of hardcore pornography, depictions of masturbation, oral or anal sex, or intercourse. Naj is a Polish language fortnightly lifestyle and women's magazine published in Warsaw, Poland. A roller disco is a discothèque or skating rink where all the dancers wear roller skates of some kind (traditional quad or inline). The music played is modern and easily danceable, historically disco but in modern times including almost any form of dance, pop or rock music. The concept originated as a fad in the 1970s when the disco craze was at its height, peaking around 1980 and inspiring several roller-disco magazines. In 1984 the fad arrived in the United Kingdom and many roller discos popped up all over the country s of 2006 , the craze has largely discontinued, although many 1970s era roller-discos are still open and successful. Also, it experienced a mild revival in the early 2000s, especially in the mid-eastern United States , where certain clubs continue to host roller disco nights. Some now use in-line roller-blades. Roller discos are also popular among older children and young teenagers, especially for parties. As in other discos, special effects such as fog machines and flashing traffic lights are often used. To minimise the risk of injury, the organisers of roller discos often only allow participants to skate in one direction at a time, so that they do not crash into one another, although many roller discos have a \"free skate\" section in the middle of the roller rink. The Alternative press in Nigeria or the press of the third kind is made up of writers who use militant approaches or viewpoints in news coverage. This usually encompasses guerrilla journalism, a term credited to some Nigerian news magazines for their radical and militant rhetoric and writings usually against the military regimes of the 1990s. The magazines consider themselves to be the last vestige of the common man and viewed certain military governments as usurpers of the people's dreams and yearnings.\n",

      "context: Prince Hamlet is the title character and protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Hamlet\".  He is the Prince of Denmark, nephew to the usurping Claudius, and son of King Hamlet, the previous King of Denmark.  At the beginning of the play, he struggles with whether, and how, to avenge the murder of his father, and struggles with his own sanity along the way.  By the end of the tragedy, Hamlet has caused the deaths of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and two acquaintances of his from the University of Wittenberg Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and of his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake). Macbeth ( ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606.  It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake.  Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, \"Macbeth\" most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.  It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. Revenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England.  Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\" which characterizes revenge tragedy \"as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself.\"  Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage.  However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including \"Troas\" (1559), \"Thyestes\" (1560), and \"Hercules Furens\" (1561).  Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to \"The Spanish Tragedy\").  Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602) and \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606). Romeo Montague (Italian: \"Romeo Montecchi\" ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".  The son of Montague and his wife, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet.  Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death. Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare.  Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as \"histories\" in the First Folio.  The Roman tragedies—\"Julius Caesar\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and \"Coriolanus\"—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories.  Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy.  They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies.  Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the \"problem play,\" for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending.  The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars. Rory Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\".  Having been introduced at the start of the 5th series, Rory joins the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) as a companion in the middle of Series 5.  As Amy Pond's fiancé, Rory is initially insecure because he believes Amy secretly loves the Doctor more.  Later, however, he proves to be a hero in his own right and he and Amy marry.  The couple conceive a daughter aboard the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, while in the time vortex, but their baby is kidnapped at birth.  In \"A Good Man Goes to War\", Rory and Amy discover their time-traveler friend River Song is actually their daughter Melody Pond.  The Doctor and River marry in \"The Wedding of River Song\", and Rory becomes the Doctor's father-in-law. Romeo and Juliet is a 1954 film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name.  It was directed by Renato Castellani and stars Laurence Harvey as Romeo, Susan Shentall as Juliet, Flora Robson as the Nurse, Mervyn Johns as Friar Laurence, Bill Travers as Benvolio, Sebastian Cabot as Lord Capulet, Ubaldo Zollo as Mercutio, Enzo Fiermonte as Tybalt and John Gielgud as the Chorus. Juliet Capulet (Italian: \"Giulietta Capuleti\" ) is the female protagonist in William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".  Juliet is the only daughter of the patriarch of the House of Capulet and falls in love with Romeo, a member of the House of Montague (with which the Capulets have a blood feud).  The story has a long history that precedes Shakespeare himself. Anna Devane is a fictional character from the original ABC Daytime soap opera, \"General Hospital\", played by Finola Hughes.  Hughes also appeared as Anna on \"All My Children\", and the \"General Hospital\" prime time, spin-off series, \"\".  The character first appeared on the April 10, 1985 episode of \"General Hospital\" as a fence.  The character was created and introduced by executive producer, Gloria Monty, and co-head writers, Pat Falken Smith and Norma Monty.  Upon her introduction, Anna is revealed to be the super spy ex-wife of Robert Scorpio and romantic rival to his current wife, Holly Sutton.  Anna remained a prominent character in the series until 1992 due to her romantic pairings with Robert and former mobster, Duke Lavery.  The storyline in which Duke tries to evade his criminal past with the Jerome family, allows for Duke and Anna to become one of the show's supercouples, along with Robert and Anna.  However, the storyline ends in tragedy when Duke dies in Anna's arms.  Robert and Anna eventually reunite to raise their daughter, Robin, and eventually remarry; the happiness is short lived and the duo are killed off in 1992 along with their rival, Cesar Faison. Benvolio is a fictional character in Shakespeare's drama \"Romeo and Juliet\".  He is Montague's nephew and Romeo's cousin.  Benvolio serves as an unsuccessful peacemaker in the play, attempting to prevent violence between the Capulet and Montague families.\n",

Romeo Montague (Italian: \"Romeo Montecchi\" ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\". The son of Montague and his wife, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet. Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death. Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as \"histories\" in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—\"Julius Caesar\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and \"Coriolanus\"—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy. They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies. Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the \"problem play,\" for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending. The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars. Rory Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\".\n",

      "segment: Having been introduced at the start of the 5th series, Rory joins the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) as a companion in the middle of Series 5. As Amy Pond's fiancé, Rory is initially insecure because he believes Amy secretly loves the Doctor more. Later, however, he proves to be a hero in his own right and he and Amy marry. The couple conceive a daughter aboard the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, while in the time vortex, but their baby is kidnapped at birth. In \"A Good Man Goes to War\", Rory and Amy discover their time-traveler friend River Song is actually their daughter Melody Pond. The Doctor and River marry in \"The Wedding of River Song\", and Rory becomes the Doctor's father-in-law. Romeo and Juliet is a 1954 film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name. It was directed by Renato Castellani and stars Laurence Harvey as Romeo, Susan Shentall as Juliet, Flora Robson as the Nurse, Mervyn Johns as Friar Laurence, Bill Travers as Benvolio, Sebastian Cabot as Lord Capulet, Ubaldo Zollo as Mercutio, Enzo Fiermonte as Tybalt and John Gielgud as the Chorus. Juliet Capulet (Italian: \"Giulietta Capuleti\" ) is the female protagonist in William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\". Juliet is the only daughter of the patriarch of the House of Capulet and falls in love with Romeo, a member of the House of Montague (with which the Capulets have a blood feud). The story has a long history that precedes Shakespeare himself. Anna Devane is a fictional character from the original ABC Daytime soap opera, \"General Hospital\", played by Finola Hughes. Hughes also appeared as Anna on \"All My Children\", and the \"General Hospital\" prime time, spin-off series, \"\". The character first appeared on the April 10, 1985 episode of \"General Hospital\" as a fence. The character was created and introduced by executive producer, Gloria Monty, and co-head writers, Pat Falken Smith and Norma Monty. Upon her introduction, Anna is revealed to be the super spy ex-wife of Robert Scorpio and romantic rival to his current wife, Holly Sutton. Anna remained a prominent character in the series until 1992 due to her romantic pairings with Robert and former mobster, Duke Lavery. The storyline in which Duke tries to evade his criminal past with the Jerome family, allows for Duke and Anna to become one of the show's supercouples, along with Robert and Anna. However, the storyline ends in tragedy when Duke dies in Anna's arms. Robert and Anna eventually reunite to raise their daughter, Robin, and eventually remarry; the happiness is short lived and the duo are killed off in 1992 along with their rival, Cesar Faison. Benvolio is a fictional character in Shakespeare's drama \"Romeo and Juliet\". He is Montague's nephew and Romeo's cousin. Benvolio serves as an unsuccessful peacemaker in the play, attempting to prevent violence between the Capulet and Montague families.\n",

      "context: The Noynoy-Binay campaign or NoyBi began when Senator Francis Escudero endorsed the candidates Benigno \"Noynoy\" Aquino III and Jejomar Binay as President and Vice President respectively.  This was done without the consent of the two candidates, especially since Escudero, Binay, and Aquino all come from different political parties.  Aquino had Manuel \"Mar\" Roxas II as his running mate for Vice President, while Binay was the Vice Presidential candidate of Joseph Estrada, who was aiming to be elected president for a second time.  The campaign was nonetheless successful as Aquino and Binay were elected as President and Vice President of the Philippines.

He is married to Samira Ramadan and has four children. A running mate is a person running together with another person on a joint ticket during an election.  The term is most often used in reference to the person in the subordinate position (such as the vice presidential candidate running with a presidential candidate) but can also properly be used when referring to both candidates, such as by saying Joko Widodo and Jusuf Kalla, and Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, were running mates in relation to the most recent presidential elections held in Indonesia and Kenya respectively.

Sam-Sumana took office as Vice President on September 17, 2007. In United States presidential elections, an unpledged elector is a person nominated to stand as an elector but who has not pledged to support any particular presidential or vice presidential candidate, and is free to vote for any candidate when elected a member of the Electoral College.  Presidential elections are indirect, with voters in each state choosing electors on Election Day in November, and these electors choosing the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in December.  Electors today are elected in every state by popular vote, and in practice have since the 19th century almost always agreed in advance to vote for a particular candidate — that is, they are said to have been \"pledged\" to that candidate.  In the 20th century, however, several elections were contested by unpledged electors, who made no pledge to any candidate before the election.  These anomalies largely arose over fissures within the Democratic Party over the issues of civil rights and segregation.  No serious general election campaign has been mounted to elect unpledged electors in any state since 1964.\n",

      "context: Opry Mills is a super-regional shopping mall owned by Simon Property Group, formerly by its initial owners Mills Corporation and Gaylord Entertainment.  It opened in Nashville, Tennessee in 2000 on the former site of the Opryland USA theme park. The Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country-music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee, which was founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio \"barn dance\" on WSM.  Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history, albeit not the longest-running one on a radio network.  Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits.  It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners. Keith Bilbrey (born August 14, 1952) is an American country music disc jockey and television host in Nashville, Tennessee.  He served as a disc jockey at Nashville's WSM, as an announcer on the Grand Ole Opry, and as the host of TNN’s Grand Ole Opry Live. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important. Ryman Auditorium (formerly Grand Ole Opry House and Union Gospel Tabernacle) is a 2,362-seat live performance venue, located at 116 5th Avenue North, in Nashville, Tennessee and is best known as the home of the \"Grand Ole Opry\" from 1943 to 1974.  It is owned and operated by Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. The Bailey Brothers and the Happy Valley Boys were an American bluegrass act widely considered to be among the first to cultivate the duo harmony vocal technique widely used in modern bluegrass music today.  Charlie Bailey (February 11, 1916 in Happy Valley, Tennessee, near Rogersville – March 12, 2004 in Bear, Delaware) began his musical career in 1936.  His brother, Danny Bailey (December 1, 1919, Happy Valley, Tennessee – March 22, 2004, Knoxville, Tennessee), teamed up with him in 1940, and the brothers began making frequent appearances on Tennessee radio stations in the Knoxville area.  Danny formed the Happy Valley Boys after Charlie joined the military in 1941.  In 1944 the Happy Valley Boys relocated to Nashville, where they became members of the Grand Ole Opry, and also made regular appearances on WSM radio in Nashville.  At that time, Danny was the youngest person to ever perform on the Grand Ole Opry.  When Charlie returned from his military service in 1946 the brothers were reunited as a duo but only stayed in Nashville briefly before returning to radio work in Knoxville.

Gaskin spent much of 2012 touring with Big & Rich, typically performing \"Mr. Bartender\" as well as a cover of Keith Whitley's \"Don't Close Your Eyes\".  Gaskin had plans for releasing a version of the Keith Whitley song prior to the problems that arose with his label.  Gaskin wrote a Tate Stevens \"Power of a Love Song\" in 2013.  Bradley performed \"Don't Close Your Eyes\" during a Grand Ole Opry performance on October 30, 2015.

The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\". Now speed has been increased. The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher. For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements. The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3. The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines. The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed. The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel. Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower. This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins. Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated. At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now. There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3. About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double. About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names). When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\". And now, the Terminal splits into two parts. The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood. The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while. This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line. The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2. Speed is now increased to 40. Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance. Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line. At 00J3.6 known as A-1. Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9). Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line. At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\". At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill. There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.\n",

      "segment: And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad. Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard. Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10. Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192. The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use. The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs. At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1. Speed is now at 40. 2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present. This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main. There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track. Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains. This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent. From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip. The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood. Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher. The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important.

So far three nations have won the competition (Australia ten times, Great Britain three times and New Zealand once).  Australia, France and New Zealand are the only teams to have played in all tournaments (Great Britain has been split into England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland since 1995, while England and Wales had previously competed as separate teams in the 1975 World Cup).  Since 2000, the RLIF has also organised World Cups for women, students and other categories.  The 2013 Rugby League World Cup was held in England and Wales and won by Australia.

This also makes them the only team to have won the world cup in all the regions (group of countries) that have hosted the world cup till now.  Besides, Australia had reached the finals of the 1975 and 1996 World cups losing to West Indies and Sri Lanka respectively.  They also reached quarterfinals of 2011 Cricket World Cup, and were knocked out in first round three times : 1979, 1983 and 1992.  Though they have won world cup record five times, they are also the only team considered as tournament favorites for every world cup, right from 1975 to present.  The team has played total 85 world cup matches, the highest of any team.  Its overall win-loss record is 61-21 (which gives it the highest win percentage among all teams playing the world cup), with one tied match and two being abandoned due to rain. Olle Nordin (born 23 November 1949 in Delary, Småland) is a Swedish football coach and former player.  He was capped 19 times for the national team and played at the 1978 FIFA World Cup, but he is best remembered for his coaching merits.

      "context: The plays written by English poet, playwright, and actor William Shakespeare (1564 – 1616) have the reputation of being among the greatest in the English language and in Western literature.  Traditionally, the plays are divided into the genres of tragedy, history, and comedy; they have been translated into every major living language, in addition to being continually performed all around the world. In his own time, William Shakespeare (1564–1616) was rated as merely one among many talented playwrights and poets, but since the late 17th century he has been considered the supreme playwright and poet of the English language. Shakespeare is an English family name most commonly associated with William Shakespeare (1564–1616), an English playwright and poet.  Other notable people with the surname include: William Shakespeare (1564–1616) was an English poet and playwright.  He wrote approximately 38 plays and 154 sonnets, as well as a variety of other poems. Timeline of Shakespeare criticism is an informal term that presents a chronological collection of critical quotations about William Shakespeare and his works, which illustrate the article Shakespeare's reputation. Pieter Brueghel the Younger or Pieter Bruegel the Younger (before 1616 he signed his name as 'Brueghel' and after 1616 as 'Breughel') (] ; between 23 May and 10 October 1564 – between March and May 1638) was a Flemish painter, known for numerous copies after his father Pieter Bruegel the Elder's work as well as his original compositions.  The large output of his studio, which produced for the local and export market, contributed to the international spread of his father's imagery. William Shakespeare (1564–1616) was an English playwright and poet. William Shakespeare was an actor, playwright, poet, and theatre entrepreneur in London during the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras.  He was baptised on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England, in the Holy Trinity Church.  At age 18 he married Anne Hathaway with whom he had three children.  He died in his home town of Stratford on 23 April 1616 at the age of 52.  Though more is known about Shakespeare's life than those of most other Elizabethan and Jacobean writers, few personal biographical facts survive about him, which is unsurprising in the light of his social status as a commoner, the low esteem in which his profession was held, and the general lack of interest of the time in the personal lives of writers.  Information about his life derives from public instead of private documents: vital records, real estate and tax records, lawsuits, records of payments, and references to Shakespeare and his works in printed and hand-written texts.  Nevertheless, hundreds of biographies have been written and more continue to be, most of which rely on inferences and the historical context of the 70 or so hard facts recorded about Shakespeare the man, a technique that sometimes leads to embellishment or unwarranted interpretation of the documented record. The Holy Sonnets—also known as the Divine Meditations or Divine Sonnets—are a series of nineteen poems by the English poet John Donne (1572–1631).  The sonnets were first published in 1633—two years after Donne's death.  The poems are sonnets and are predominantly in the style and form prescribed by Renaissance Italian poet Petrarch (or Francesco Petrarca) (1304–1374) in which the sonnet consisted of two quatrains (four-line stanzas) and a sestet (a six-line stanza).  However, several rhythmic and structural patterns as well as the inclusion of couplets are elements influenced by the sonnet form developed by English poet and playwright William Shakespeare (1564–1616). William Shakespeare ( ; 26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.  He is often called England's national poet, and the \"Bard of Avon\".  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.  His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.\n",

William Shakespeare (1564–1616) was an English playwright and poet. William Shakespeare was an actor, playwright, poet, and theatre entrepreneur in London during the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras. He was baptised on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England, in the Holy Trinity Church. At age 18 he married Anne Hathaway with whom he had three children. He died in his home town of Stratford on 23 April 1616 at the age of 52. Though more is known about Shakespeare's life than those of most other Elizabethan and Jacobean writers, few personal biographical facts survive about him, which is unsurprising in the light of his social status as a commoner, the low esteem in which his profession was held, and the general lack of interest of the time in the personal lives of writers. Information about his life derives from public instead of private documents: vital records, real estate and tax records, lawsuits, records of payments, and references to Shakespeare and his works in printed and hand-written texts. Nevertheless, hundreds of biographies have been written and more continue to be, most of which rely on inferences and the historical context of the 70 or so hard facts recorded about Shakespeare the man, a technique that sometimes leads to embellishment or unwarranted interpretation of the documented record. The Holy Sonnets—also known as the Divine Meditations or Divine Sonnets—are a series of nineteen poems by the English poet John Donne (1572–1631). The sonnets were first published in 1633—two years after Donne's death. The poems are sonnets and are predominantly in the style and form prescribed by Renaissance Italian poet Petrarch (or Francesco Petrarca) (1304–1374) in which the sonnet consisted of two quatrains (four-line stanzas) and a sestet (a six-line stanza). However, several rhythmic and structural patterns as well as the inclusion of couplets are elements influenced by the sonnet form developed by English poet and playwright William Shakespeare (1564–1616). William Shakespeare ( ; 26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \"Bard of Avon\".\n",

      "context: Amelia Cary, Viscountess Falkland (21 March 1807 – 2 July 1858) was a British noblewoman.  Born the fifth illegitimate daughter of William IV of the United Kingdom (then Duke of Clarence) by his long-time mistress Dorothea Jordan.  Amelia had four sisters and five brothers all surnamed FitzClarence.  Soon after their father became monarch, the FitzClarence children were raised to the ranks of younger children of a marquess.  A granddaughter of George III, Amelia was named after her aunt Princess Amelia. John Crichton-Stuart, 5th Marquess of Bute (4 August 1907 – 14 August 1956) was the son of John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute and Augusta Bellingham.  On his father's side, the 5th Marquess was a direct male-line descendant of Robert II of Scotland through John Stewart, his illegitimate son by Moira Leitch.  On his mother's side, the 5th Marquess was a descendant of William IV of the United Kingdom through Elizabeth Hay, Countess of Erroll, one of his illegitimate daughters by his mistress, Dorothea Jordan.  As such, the 5th Marquess was the first member of the Bute family to be descended from William IV. Dorothea Jordan (22 November 17615 July 1816) was an Anglo-Irish actress, courtesan, and the mistress and companion of the future King William IV of the United Kingdom, for 20 years while he was Duke of Clarence.  Together they had ten illegitimate children, all of whom took the surname \"FitzClarence\". Lady Mary Fox (née FitzClarence; 19 December 1798 – 13 July 1864) was an illegitimate daughter of King William IV of the United Kingdom by his mistress Dorothea Jordan.  In later life she became a writer. Elizabeth Hay, Countess of Erroll (17 January 1801 – 16 January 1856; born Elizabeth FitzClarence) was an illegitimate daughter of King William IV of the United Kingdom and Dorothea Jordan.  She married William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll, and became Countess of Erroll on 4 December 1820 at age 19.  Due to Hay's parentage, William Hay became Lord Steward of the Household.  Elizabeth and William Hay married at St George's, Hanover Square.  Hay is pictured in a FitzClarence family portrait in House of Dun and kept a stone thrown at her father William IV and the gloves he wore on opening his first Parliament as mementos.  She died in Edinburgh, Scotland. Lieutenant-General Lord Frederick FitzClarence, GCH (9 December 1799 – 30 October 1854) was a British Army officer as well as being the illegitimate third son of King William IV and his mistress, Dorothea Jordan. Lady Augusta Gordon (\"née\" FitzClarence; 17 November 1803 – 8 December 1865) was a British noblewoman.

She was married to Philip Sidney, 1st Baron De L'Isle and Dudley, and had four surviving children.  Shortly before her death in 1837, she served as State Housekeeper in Kensington Palace. The Regency Act 1830 (1 Will.4 c.2) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed to cater for the event that King William IV died while the next person in line to the throne was not yet aged 18.  It provided for a regency until the new monarch reached the age of 18, and also would have enabled a posthumous child of King William IV to replace Queen Victoria on the throne.  However, the Act never came into force, because William was not survived by a legitimate child and Victoria became queen at the age of 18 in 1837. Wilhelmina FitzClarence, Countess of Munster (\"née\" Kennedy-Erskine; 27 June 1830 – 9 October 1906) was a British peeress and novelist.

      "context: Don't Stop the Music is the third studio album by Swedish pop singer Robyn.  It was released on 30 October 2002 in Sweden by BMG.  The album peaked at #2 in her native Sweden, and the two singles \"Keep This Fire Burning\" and \"Don't Stop the Music\" were both top 10 hits.  In 2003, \"Don't Stop The Music\" was certified platinum by IFPI, and has sold over 60,000 copies in Sweden. \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" is a 1966 song written and composed by Holland–Dozier–Holland.  It first became a popular \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one hit for the American Motown group The Supremes in late 1966.  The rock band Vanilla Fudge covered the song a year later and had a top ten hit with their version.  British pop singer Kim Wilde covered \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" in 1986, bumping it back to number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in June 1987.  The single reached number one by two different musical acts in America.  In the first 32 years of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 rock era, “You Keep Me Hangin' On” became one of only six songs to achieve this feat.  In 1996, country music singer Reba McEntire's version reached number 2 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart. American entertainer Madonna has released 68 music videos, 11 concert tour videos, 2 documentary videos, 4 music video compilations, 2 music video box sets, 4 promotional videos, and 5 video singles.  In 1982, Madonna signed a recording contract with Sire Records and released her first two singles before launching her eponymous debut album.  Her first video to receive attention on MTV was \"Borderline\", followed by \"Lucky Star\" and \"Like a Virgin\", which popularized Madonna's image and fashion among younger generation.  Her early videos were released commercially on \"Madonna\" (1984), which became the best-selling videocassette of 1985.  With the title track from her third studio album \"True Blue\" (1986), Madonna's impact on MTV and popular music was established when a contest entitled \"Making My Video\", was held to create a music video for the song. \" La Isla Bonita\" and \"Who's That Girl\", both released in 1987, showed Madonna's fascination with Hispanic culture and religious symbolism.  In 1989, the video of \"Like a Prayer\" portrayed her dancing in front of burning crosses, receiving stigmata, kissing a black saint and having sex with him in a church altar.  It faced strong reaction from religious groups and media. \" Express Yourself\" released the same year was critically appreciated for its positive feminist themes. Ghost is a Swedish record producing and songwriting team, composed of Ulf Lindström and Johan Ekhé, based in New York City.  They are perhaps best known for writing and producing Swedish singer Robyn's three first studio albums, \"Robyn Is Here\" (1996), \"My Truth\" (1999), and \"Don't Stop the Music\" (2002).  Robyn's \"Keep This Fire Burning\" from 2003 was the fourth most played song by Swedish songwriters on Swedish radio from 2000–2009.  It was later covered by British soul singer Beverley Knight. \"Keep This Fire Burning\" is a song by Swedish pop singer Robyn, released as the first single from her third album \"Don't Stop the Music\".  It was released in Sweden on September 21, 2002, where it became her highest charting single since 1995's \"Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect)\".  The song was also released as a single in Australia under the name \"By Your Side\", due to the Australian bush fires which were happening at the time.  In 2008, a re-recorded version of the song appeared on the special edition of Robyn's eponymous album. \"I'll Keep the Lovelight Burning\" is a popular song written in 1942 by Harry Tobias, Nick Kenny, and Harold Levey, popularized by Patti Page in 1949.

William Ford Gibson (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian speculative fiction writer and essayist widely credited with pioneering the science fiction subgenre known as cyberpunk.  Beginning his writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were noir, near-future stories that explored the effects of technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humans—a \"combination of lowlife and high tech\"—and helped to create an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.  Gibson notably coined the term \"cyberspace\" in his short story \"Burning Chrome\" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel \"Neuromancer\" (1984).  These early works have been credited with \"renovating\" science fiction literature after it had fallen largely into insignificance in the 1970s. Phil Driscoll (born November 9, 1947) is a trumpeter, singer, composer, and producer.  He performs in varying music genres and styles which include rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and patriotic music, and is best known for his work in Christian music and his longterm Christian ministry.

He has also won three Dove Awards for his music, and the 1999 Christian Country Music Association Award for Best Musician.  In 2006, Driscoll was found guilty on 2 counts of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy, and was sentenced to serve one year in Federal prison, beginning on March 14, 2007. Clara Ann Fowler (November 8, 1927 – January 1, 2013), known by her professional name Patti Page, was an American singer of traditional pop music and country music.  She was the top-charting female vocalist and best-selling female artist of the 1950s, selling over 100 million records during a six-decade long career.  She was often introduced as \"the Singin' Rage, Miss Patti Page\".  New York WNEW disc-jockey William B. Williams introduced her as \"A Page in my life called Patti\". Burning the clavie is an ancient Scottish custom still observed at Burghead, a fishing village on the Moray Firth.  The \"clavie\" is a collection of casks split in two, lit as a bonfire in the evening of 11 January, i.e. New Year's Eve (in Scotland, Hogmanay) by the Julian Calendar.  One of these casks is joined together again by a huge nail (Latin \"clavis\"; hence the term, it may also be from Scottish Gaelic \"cliabh\", a basket used for holding combustibles).  It is then filled with tar, lighted and carried flaming round the village and finally up to a headland upon which stands the ruins of an altar, locally called the \"Doorie\".  It here forms the nucleus of the bonfire, which is built up of split casks.  When the burning tar-barrel falls in pieces, the people scramble to get a lighted piece with which to kindle the New Year's fire on their cottage hearth.  The charcoal of the \"clavie\" is collected and put in pieces up the cottage chimneys, to keep spirits and witches from coming down.\n",

      "context: The Jeguk Sinmun (\"Imperial Post\"; 1898-1910) was a Seoul-based Korean language newspaper founded in 1898 by Yi Jong-myeon.  It was published using the purely vernacular Hangeul script and attracted a largely lower or middle class and female readership.  It was less political than the other papers of the period, concentrating instead on social issues.  One of its early reporters was the young Syngman Rhee. Velvetpark: Dyke Culture in Bloom is a lesbian and feminist arts and culture website that regularly features music, literature, theater, fine arts, film, television, and social activism as it impacts queer culture.  \"Velvetpark\" also hosts a social network and dating community for lesbians and queer-identified women. Anna Kalata (born May 10, 1964, Milanówek, Poland) is a Polish politician, celebrity and occasional actress.  She was a member of the populist Samoobrona party.  In Jarosław Kaczyński's cabinet she was the minister of labour and social policy.  She participated in the 12th season of Taniec z Gwiazdami (the Polish version of Dancing With The Stars).  After losing 38 kg she appeared on the cover of Shape magazine. Shape is a monthly English language fitness magazine started by Weider Publications in 1981, founded by Christine MacIntyre (a pioneer in women's free weight fitness) and became the number one women's fitness magazine.  At that time, Weider Enterprises consisted primarily of the bodybuilding magazine \"Muscle & Fitness\".  Joe Weider and Christine MacIntyre had differing views of how to present \"Shape\", Weider endorsing a less journalistic and more commercial approach to articles, MacIntyre endorsing a more academic, doctor-based magazine.  Weider also endorsed a sexier approach to editorial while MacIntyre endorsed a healthier look for women, eschewing sexiness in the models and the copy.  MacIntyre largely won that battle, editing a magazine that required that every byline have an advanced medical degree, that cover models should look healthy rather than sexy, and that sexist language be avoided.  Christine MacIntyre was the editor-in-chief until her death in 1988.  Tara Kraft is the current editor-in-chief.  \"Shape\" found a readership based on that formula. Cynthia Heimel (née Glick) (born 1947 in Philadelphia) is a feminist humorist writer from Oakland, California.  She is a columnist and the author of satirical books primarily aimed at a female readership and known for their unusual titles, as well as a playwright and television writer. Femme is a lesbian sexual identity that was created in the working class lesbian bar culture of the 1950s.  It is a term used to distinguish feminine lesbian and bisexual women from their butch/stud lesbian counterparts and partners.  Today the term is still used in this way but in recent years - following the influence of Queer gender identity theories - its meaning has, sometimes contentiously, been expanded to describe a queer-identified person who is feminine in their presentation regardless of their gender or sexuality. A chapstick lesbian is a sub-group within lesbianism that Ellen DeGeneres popularised in 1997 in her show \"Ellen\".  It was originally constructed as response to the phrase \"lipstick lesbian\" that emerged in 1990, which refers to a femme lesbian who emphasises their female identity through their self-presentation.  The slang term \"chapstick lesbian\" identifies a category on the femme-butch lesbian continuum, where the female homosexual has a gender identity bias towards femme lesbianism, although does not identify or fit the criteria of being a lipstick lesbian.  The word is frequently used as an alternative to the term \"soft-butch\" lesbian or androgynous.  The key attributes recognisable of a chapstick lesbian is that they have a casual dress-code and lack of desire to wear make-up.  Next to this, they are also viewed as being athletic in nature and have a notable interest in sport. Elana Amsterdam is the New York Times Bestselling author of \"Paleo Cooking from Elana's Pantry\".  She writes cookbooks for gluten-free cooking, using almond flour and coconut flour as a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour.  Her book, \"The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook\", was named one of the \"Best Cookbooks of 2009\" by The Denver Post.  Amsterdam has partnered with the California Almond Board in conjunction with her works.  Her blog, elanaspantry.com, was named one of the top 50 food blogs by Cision.  Amsterdam contributed an article to Shape Magazine and she was featured on Fox News's On the Hunt with Jonathan Hunt. Shōjo, shojo, or shoujo manga (少女漫画 , shōjo manga ) is manga aimed at a teenage female readership.  The name romanizes the Japanese 少女 (shōjo), literally \"young woman\".  Shōjo manga covers many subjects in a variety of narrative styles, from historical drama to science fiction, often with a focus on romantic relationships or emotions.  Strictly speaking, however, shōjo manga does not comprise a style or genre, but rather indicates a target demographic. The term celesbian (a portmanteau of \"celebrity\" and \"lesbian\") originally referred to a female celebrity known or reputed to be a lesbian and popular within the LGBT community.  Celesbianism as a Western media phenomenon came into vogue in 2008, when several female celebrities presented themselves as lesbians.  The term was first used by New Yorkers Pam Franco and Susan Levine, a disk jockey.  It was used in a full-page ad in a lesbian nightlife magazine, \"GO MAGAZINE\".  The ad was for the Mz Hip and Fit NY contest, the idea of Denise Cohen of Denco Designs & Events.  The contest was a search for the hottest lesbian in the United States.  The term \"celesbian\" was used for the celebrity lesbian judges.\n",
